# Decision Log

- 10/12/2025
  - Beginning of project
  - Tech stack
    - KMP for front end
      - iOS, Desktop, Android
      - used this because I want to learn the technology lol
      - decided to skip web because it's experimental and I don't really want or see a reason to make this a web app
      - SQLDelight with SQLite because it makes things easy
        - I can model the data on the front and back end very similarly
    - Spring boot for back end
      - Kotlin so I can use one language
      - Flyway for migrations because it's the best
      - JPA because I'm lazy
    - I'm choosing to have this app be offline-first, but I'm including a back end because I want to be able to have this app sync across devices as well as to be able to have more flexibility in the features I can provide.
    - Sometimes having a server is handy
    - I also want to learn how to make a sync engine

  - Basic recipe CRUD on back end
  - I think at the time, I had a different vision for how the app should work, so that's why I made the models on the back end lol

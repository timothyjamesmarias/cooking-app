Purpose of this folder

This shared module uses SQLDelight to generate a type-safe database API. The package `com.timothymarias.cookingapp.shared.db` referenced in code (e.g., CookingDatabase) is GENERATED by the SQLDelight compiler — it is not a separate Gradle module.

Where the generated code comes from
- The schema and queries live under: src/commonMain/sqldelight/com/timothymarias/cookingapp/shared/db
  - Example: recipes.sq defines the `recipes` table and the `selectAll` query.
- The Gradle configuration (build.gradle.kts) declares the database:
  - sqldelight { databases { create("CookingDatabase") { packageName.set("com.timothymarias.cookingapp.shared.db") } } }

How to generate the code
- Run a Gradle sync/build for the shared module. The SQLDelight plugin generates the `CookingDatabase` class and query interfaces in the configured package.

Troubleshooting
- If imports like `com.timothymarias.cookingapp.shared.db.CookingDatabase` appear unresolved, ensure the project builds successfully — codegen only runs on build.
- Platform driver setup is provided via expect/actual in `data/local/DatabaseDriverFactory*`. These require platform-specific SQLDelight driver dependencies to be present.
- JS driver is currently stubbed and will be implemented later.
